=== Options

JavaScript library for building SVG elements to represent options.

==== Option State

The following call to `a4.generateOptionStateSvg`:

[source,javascript]
----
var underlyingCommodityPriceAtPurchase = 60;
var strikePrice = 65;
var premium = 6;

var option = new a4.Option(a4.optionType.CALL, underlyingCommodityPriceAtPurchase, strikePrice, premium);
var currentPrice = 62;
var plotRange = { start: 50, end: 70 };

var container = d3.select("#optionSvgContainerId");

a4.generateOptionStateSvg(container, option, currentPrice, plotRange);
----

Will generate an SVG like this:

* the solid line indicates ownership of the underlying commodity on expiry
* the dashed line indicates non-ownership of the underlying commodity on expiry
* the transition between the lines represents the strike price
* the black dot was the price of the underlying commodity at time of option purchase
* green triangle represents current price of underlying commodity
